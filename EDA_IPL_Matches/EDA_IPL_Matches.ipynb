    "\n",
    "- From the season __2011-2013__, we had the most number of matches from other seasons and __2013__ season has the most number of matches.\n",
    "- the highest number of matches had been played at __Mumbai__, followed by __Delhi, Kolkata and Bangalore__ in order.\n",
    "-  __Mumbai Indians__ seem to be very lucky having the highest win in tosses followed by __Kolkata Knight Riders__. __Kochi Tuskers Kerala__ had the lowest wins as they have played the lowest matches also. \n",
    "- The match winning probability for toss winning team was about __60%-40%__. \n",
    "- The decision for batting or fielding varies largely across the seasons. In some seasons, the probability that toss winners opt for __batting is high__, while it is not the case in other seasons. In 2016 though, the majority of toss winners opted for batting.\n",
    "- __Gujarat Loins__ takes up fielding almost all the time. On the other hand, __Chennai Super Kings__ usually takes up batting. __Mumbai Indians__ has picked up batting and fielding almost equal number of times.\n",
    "- __Royal Challengers Bangalore__ (considered a batting heavy side) seems to be winning many matches by a huge margin. __Mumbai Indians and Kolkata Knight Riders__ (both considered balanced sides) show almost similar behaviour with victories distributed quite evenly.  Apparently, __Mumbai Indians__ also appears to hold the record for the biggest win by runs and the best defending team.\n",
    "- __Royal Challengers Bangalore__ best chasing team and won __three__ times by maximum wickets taken.\n",
    "- Maximum times Duckworth-Lewis Method have been applied at __Kolkata__. followed by Delhi and Bangalore.\n",
    "- __S Ravi__ had umpired maximum IPL matches.\n",
    "- __Mumbai Indians__ are clearly the most successful teams followed by __Chennai Super Kings__ and __Kolkata Knight Riders__. __Sunrisers Hyderabad__, __Gujarat Lions__ and __Deccan Chargers__ (which is now defunct) are trailing. But this is because of the lesser number of seasons they have played in. Therefore __Delhi Daredevils__ is the most unsuccessful IPL team.\n",
    "- __Chris Gayle__ leads and holds the record for the highest number of awards won, of course, __AB de Villiers__ is also placed second in the list."
